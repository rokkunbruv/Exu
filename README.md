# Exu

Exu is my first hobby programming language written in Rust. It is a general-purpose programming language that supports functional and object-oriented features. The design of the language syntax and semantics are primarily inspired from Go and Rust.

## Features

For a detailed documentation of the language features and syntax of Exu, refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/rokkunbruv/Exu/wiki/Exu's-Syntax-and-Semantics).

### Static Typing

Exu requires its users to explicitly declare the variable types. It currently supports **numeric** _(64-bit floating point numbers)_, **string**, **boolean**, **function**, and **entity** types.

### First-Class Functions

Exu supports higher-order functions and functions as values.

### Entities and Actions

Similar to languages like Go and Rust, Exu supports structs and struct methods for object-orientation called **entities** and **actions** respectively.
